	PROJECT: NativeScript Hello World!
	----------------------------------

	My Hello World project following the official docs and API reference, with some of my own research to find out how to use NS.

	Notes:

		To debug use `ns debug [ios|android] --debug-brk --emulator`

		Finding class properties, such as for the TextField component ( these properties are defined in the base classes of the TextField component. Take a look here - http://docs.nativescript.org/ApiReference/ui/text-field/TextField.html and just click on the classes from which the TextField inherits to see what other properties are available. )
